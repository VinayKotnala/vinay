a result of 1 if both bits are otherwise it returns 0"""

bits are 1 and it gives 0 if both bits are 0."""

# << Binary Right Shift operator

bits to the right. Excess bits(after the decimal(.)) shifted off to the right are discarded.

bits to the left. Excess bits shifted off to the left are discarded. 
Zero bits are shifted in from the righ"""
